# Dice Game

A fun dice game for two players, created in JavaScript.

Here are the rules:

1. The first player to reach 100 points wins.
2. Points are earned by rolling dice.
3. Each person can roll the dice as many times as they want to score points, however if they roll a 1, their score for that turn automatically sets to 0, and they can no longer roll for that turn. For example, if I rolled a 6 and a 4, my score would be 10 points for that round if I choose to cash the points in. You ideally want to stack up as many points as possible without rolling a one.
4. There is a roll and hold option, to roll the dice to accumulate points, and hold to cash in the points accumulated for that turn, respectively.

Side note: The game is automated to switch turns to the other player as soon as one player rolls a 1.

Have fun!
