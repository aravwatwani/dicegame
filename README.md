our dice game!

the name of this game is called pig. the rules are:

1. first player to 100 points wins
2. points are earned by rolling dice
3. each person can roll the dice as many times as they want to score points, however if they roll a 1, their score for that turn automatically sets to 0. for example, if i rolled a 6 and a 4, my score would be 10 points for that round if i choose to cash the points in. you ideally want to stack up as many points as possible without rolling a one.
4. theres a roll and hold option, pretty self-explanatory.

have fun!
