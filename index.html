  <h4>The name of this game is called Pig. The rules are:<br><br>

    1. First player to 100 points wins <br> 2. Points are earned by rolling dice <br>
    3. Each person can roll the dice as many times as they want to score points, however if they roll a 1, their score for that turn automatically sets to 0. For example, if I rolled a 6 and a 4, my score would be 10 points for that round if I
    choose to cash the points in. You ideally want to stack up as many points as possible without rolling a 1. <br>
    4. There's a roll and hold option, so that is pretty self-explanatory. <br><br>

    Have fun!</h4>
